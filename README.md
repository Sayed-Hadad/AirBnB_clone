# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console README

## Project Description
The "0x00. AirBnB clone - The console" project is a command-line interface (CLI) program designed to mimic the basic functionalities of the AirBnB website. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with objects such as users, places, and reviews in a console environment.

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a Python-based CLI program that serves as the interface for interacting with the AirBnB clone project. It provides a set of commands for performing various operations, including creating, updating, deleting, and displaying objects, as well as loading and saving data.

### How to Start the Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the project files in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the command `./console.py` to start the interpreter.

### How to Use the Interpreter
Once the interpreter is running, you can enter commands followed by any arguments as needed. The interpreter will execute the command and provide feedback on the result. Here are some basic guidelines for using the interpreter:

- Enter commands in the format: `command_name argument1 argument2 ...`
- Use the `help` command to get information about available commands and their usage.
- Use the `quit` or `EOF` command to exit the interpreter.
